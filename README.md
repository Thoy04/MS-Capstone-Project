## Using ML to predict the winner of the NBA Most Improved Player award.

### Summary: 
This project explored the viability of machine learning techniques to predict the winner of the NBAâ€™s most improved player award. This project had a heavy focus on preparing data for the modeling stage, including feature engineering and use of the SMOTE technique to balance the data. Six models were trained and tested on data on the  1987-2023 seasons. The best models correctly predicted the winner in 78% of the seasons, including the final 9. Viability for use as part of a sports betting strategy was also briefly explored.
